## Acknowledgments

* This was stared during the Firefox extension hackaton in Paris Mozila.

## Road Map

* We should find a solution to hide the api ID and make the application more easy to hack to be used by any Twitch streaming wanting his own twitch/youtube plugin.
* Use of Youtube Api to make notification on new video published and badges to show how many video to watch.
